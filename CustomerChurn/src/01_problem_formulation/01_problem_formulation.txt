# Problem Formulation

## 1. Business Problem Definition

Customer churn occurs when an existing customer stops using a companyâ€™s services or purchasing its products.
High churn rates can significantly impact a business by reducing revenue, increasing acquisition costs, and benefiting competitors.
Addressing customer churn through predictive analytics can help businesses take proactive measures to retain customers
and improve long-term profitability.

## 2. Business Objectives

The primary objective of this project is to develop an automated data management pipeline
that enables the prediction of customer churn using machine learning. Key goals include:
- Reducing customer churn rates by identifying at-risk customers.
- Enhancing customer retention strategies by providing actionable insights.
- Automating data collection, preprocessing, and model deployment.
- Ensuring scalability and robustness in the pipeline architecture.

## 3. Key Data Sources and Attributes

The project will utilize data from multiple sources, including:

- **Web Logs**: User activity data from company websites and mobile applications.
- **Transactional Systems**: Purchase history, payment records, and subscription details.
- **Third-Party APIs**: External customer behavior and sentiment data.
- **Customer Service Interactions**: Support tickets, call logs, and feedback forms.

### Data Attributes

Typical attributes from these sources include:

- **Customer Information**: ID, age, gender, location, subscription type.
- **Transaction Data**: Purchase frequency, amount spent, payment method.
- **Engagement Metrics**: Website visits, time spent, click-through rates.
- **Customer Support Interactions**: Number of support tickets, resolution time.
- **Churn Label**: Historical churn data (binary: churned vs. retained).

## 4. Expected Pipeline Outputs

The pipeline should produce the following key outputs:

- **Cleaned Datasets**: Processed and structured datasets for exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- **Feature-Engineered Data**: Transformed and normalized features suitable for machine learning models.
- **Predictive Model**: A deployable machine learning model capable of predicting customer churn.

## 5. Measurable Evaluation Metrics

To assess the performance of the churn prediction model, the following metrics will be used:

- **Accuracy**: Overall correctness of the predictions.
- **Precision & Recall**: Trade-off between false positives and false negatives.
- **F1-Score**: Balance between precision and recall.
- **ROC-AUC Score**: Ability of the model to distinguish between churned and non-churned customers.
- **Business Impact Metrics**: Reduction in churn rate, increased retention percentage.

This document serves as the foundation for designing and implementing the end-to-end data management pipeline
for customer churn prediction.
